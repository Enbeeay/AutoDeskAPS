# AutoDesk APS Integration

# Introduction

This project is an automation module that works with the AutoDesk API to pull construction data from the AutoDesk Construction Cloud and write it to company tables as well as editing data and posting new data. About 100 scripts were written in total to access around 35 different endpoints in the cloud. The scripts make REST calls to the construction cloud to perform data manipulation. This is a project created during a summer internship at Gaylor Electric Inc and is currently being used in the company's integrations.
